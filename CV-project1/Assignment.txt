Define a Vehicle class with protected attributes, name and producer character strings or
strings, wheels of int type. The class has adequate constructors/destructor and set/get
methods for each attribute. The class will also contain a virtual display method that will
display on the screen the attributes using a user manipulator each attribute left aligned in
a 30-width zone. The class will allow to write a Vehicle object in an output file by
overloading the << operator. The Car class inherits in public mode the class Vehicle and
adds the private attributes power and capacity of int type. The class will consider
adequate constructors/ destructor set/get methods and will overload the << operator
including for the new attributes of the class to write a Car object in an output file. The Car
class will override the virtual display method adding the new attributes of the class.
In main define 2 objects for the first Vehicle class, first, with predefined attributes, the
other, no parameters. In the same mode for the derived class Car.
For each class assign the first object defined with predefined attributes to the second
object no parameters of the class and clone the first object with predefined attributes to a
new specific class object.
Write the initial first objects and the cloned objects from each class in a file with the name
Vehicle.txt (2+2) and display all objects (3+3) with display methods.
Consider a base class pointer. Associate the pointer to the initial base class object, modify
the attributes using class setters, display the new obtained object and write the object in
the file. With the same base class pointer, associated to the initial derived class object
modify with setters all allowed attributes. Also modify all other attributes, display the
new obtained object, and write the object in the file.
